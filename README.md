# Classifiers

A repository of basic classifiers from COM2004

## Usage
Ensure that the data txt is formatted with one sample per line, with values separated by commas - no whitespaces.
The classifiers assume that the class labels are at the end of each line, so ensure they are in the expected position else the classifier won't classify anything correctly.


## Current Classifiers
